### **Project: ZenithCore (ZIMPA-RT)**
### **A Digital Twin-Enabled Smart Production Process Planning Tool**

#### **1. General Overview of the Proposed Solution**

**Main Scope:**
ZenithCore is a data-driven software solution designed to create robust, flexible, and intelligent production planning strategies. The core of the project is to develop a tool that moves beyond traditional scheduling by integrating deep analysis of customer demand patterns directly into the planning process. By leveraging historical data and future demand signals, ZenithCore provides manufacturers with the foresight needed to optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve delivery reliability.

**Main Objectives:**
*   To develop a solution that uses historical and future demand patterns to build resilient, data-driven production planning strategies.
*   To create a dedicated module that analyzes customer demand trends over time to uncover patterns, enabling the classification of customers based on their specific demand characteristics.
*   To utilize a Digital Twin of the production environment to simulate and validate planning strategies, ensuring optimal resource allocation and workflow.
*   To empower planners with an interactive "what-if" scenario analysis tool to make informed decisions when faced with new orders or unexpected disruptions.
*   To enhance visibility and collaboration through intuitive data visualizations, such as interactive Gantt charts.

#### **2. Technology Concept**

The technology behind ZenithCore is built on a dual-core architecture: a **Demand Intelligence Module** and a **Production Simulation Core**, which together form the Digital Twin.

1.  **Demand Intelligence Module:** This is the analytical engine of the platform. It will process historical order data (e.g., from an ERP or CRM) to identify key patterns such as seasonality, order frequency, volume fluctuations, and product mix. Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering), this module will automatically group customers into meaningful segments (e.g., "High-Volume/Low-Mix", "Sporadic/High-Mix"). The output will be a rich dataset of customer profiles and demand forecasts that serve as the primary input for the planning phase.

2.  **Production Simulation Core (Digital Twin):** This core takes the demand forecasts and customer profiles from the intelligence module and combines them with a real-time model of the factory floor. This model includes workstation availability, shift calendars, scheduled maintenance, lead times, and setup times (`AdvancedSchedulingService`). The core engine generates an optimized production plan that is not only efficient but also tailored to the nature of the demand. Its powerful "what-if" simulation capability (`SimulationService`) allows planners to inject new, hypothetical orders into this data-rich environment and instantly see the impact on the entire production schedule, ensuring that every decision is validated against the real-world capacity and demand structure.

#### **3. Fit within the AID4SME Project**

ZenithCore is designed to directly address the requirements outlined in **Challenge 3.1 – Digital Twin-Enabled Smart Production Process Planning Tool** of the AID4SME Open Call [[Source](https://aid4sme.eu/open-call-1/#)].

*   **Alignment with Point 1:** The project directly provides a *“solution that uses historical demand patterns and future demands to build more robust, flexible, and data-driven planning strategies.”* Our Demand Intelligence Module is specifically designed to uncover these patterns, while the Production Simulation Core uses this intelligence to build and validate optimized plans, moving away from static, inefficient scheduling.

*   **Alignment with Point 2:** ZenithCore explicitly includes a tool that will *“analyze customer demand trends over time to uncover patterns and enable the grouping and classification of customers based on their demand characteristics.”* This is the primary function of our Demand Intelligence Module, which will provide the customer segmentation needed to create differentiated and more effective planning strategies (e.g., make-to-stock for predictable demand segments, make-to-order for volatile ones).

By combining demand analysis with a process-centric Digital Twin, ZenithCore delivers a comprehensive solution that perfectly matches the innovation goals of the AID4SME project.
