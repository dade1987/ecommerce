### **Green Deal Alignment KPIs**

| KPI     | Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                              | Target Unit      |
|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
| **KPI-01**  | Material Waste Reduction       | Measures the percentage reduction in material scrap by identifying and correcting planning conflicts through simulation before physical production starts. | >15%             |
| **KPI-02**  | Asset Utilization Efficiency   | Measures the increase in the productive time of machinery and workstations by minimizing idle periods through algorithmically-optimized scheduling.         | >10%             |
| **KPI-03**  | Overproduction Reduction       | Measures the reduction in finished goods inventory that exceeds forecasted demand, aligning production volume more closely with real market needs.      | >20%             |
| **KPI-04**  | Energy Efficiency Improvement  | Measures the reduction in average energy consumed per unit produced, achieved by creating more compact schedules that reduce machine idle time.         | >5%              |
