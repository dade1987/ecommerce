### **Project Planning**

The work plan for ZenithCore is structured according to the four stages of the AID4SME programme. A critical aspect of our project is its advanced maturity level (TRL 6). The core platform, including the `AdvancedSchedulingService` and `SimulationService`, is already a functional Proof of Concept (POC). This allows us to adopt an **early adopter strategy**, leveraging the initial programme stages to focus on developing advanced, tailor-made functionalities on top of the existing robust foundation, rather than building from the ground up.

#### **Stage 1: Plan (Month 1)**

*   **Work Organization:** This stage will not be for initial project planning, but for a **deep-dive analysis and co-creation workshop** with the industrial use-case partner. We will map their specific data flows, finalize the precise requirements for the `Demand Intelligence Module`, and identify any high-value custom integrations (e.g., with their existing ERP/MES) that will maximize the solution's impact.
*   **Expected Output:** A comprehensive technical specification and a detailed integration roadmap, fully aligned with the partner's needs.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **D1.1: Detailed Feature Specification & Customization Plan:** A document outlining the precise logic for the demand analysis module and any partner-specific adjustments.
    *   **D1.2: Technical Integration & Data Mapping Document:** A plan detailing API endpoints, data formats, and the workflow for connecting ZenithCore to the partner's systems.

#### **Stage 2: Development (Months 2-8)**

*   **Work Organization:** Leveraging the existing codebase, this stage is dedicated to building the **new, value-added modules** identified in Stage 1. The core development team will focus on:
    1.  Developing and training the machine learning models for the `Demand Intelligence Module`.
    2.  Implementing the specific data connectors for seamless integration.
    3.  Refining the UI/UX to incorporate the new features and ensure an intuitive user experience for the partner.
*   **Expected Output:** A feature-complete, enhanced version of the ZenithCore platform, ready for pilot deployment in a real-world environment.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **D2.1: ZenithCore Platform v1.0 Release:** The fully functional software including the new modules.
    *   **D2.2: Source Code & Technical Documentation v1.0:** The complete, documented codebase for the new modules.

#### **Stage 3: Testing & Validation (Months 9-10)**

*   **Work Organization:** We will deploy the ZenithCore v1.0 platform at the industrial partner's facility. The system will run in parallel with their existing planning processes, allowing for direct comparison and validation. We will collect real-time data to measure the performance against the defined KPIs (e.g., scrap rate reduction, asset utilization).
*   **Expected Output:** A robust, validated solution operating in a relevant industrial environment. A quantitative report confirming the solution's benefits.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **D3.1: Pilot Deployment & Validation Report:** A report detailing the testing process, user feedback, and results.
    *   **D3.2: KPI Performance Analysis Report:** A data-driven analysis showing the measured improvements against the baseline.

#### **Stage 4: Solution Assessment & Business Plan (Months 11-14)**

*   **Work Organization:** This final stage is focused on leveraging the project's success for future growth. We will analyze the pilot results to create a compelling case study and refine the solution based on the final feedback. Concurrently, we will develop a comprehensive commercialization strategy, defining the go-to-market plan, pricing models, and a feature roadmap for the next 2-3 years.
*   **Expected Output:** A market-ready product and a solid, data-backed business plan for its commercial launch.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **D4.1: Final Solution Assessment Report & Case Study:** A summary of the project's outcomes and a marketing-ready case study.
    *   **D4.2: Commercialization & Business Plan:** A detailed plan for bringing ZenithCore to the wider market.
